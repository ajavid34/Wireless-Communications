## Computer Assignment 1
In this assignment, our main objective is to simulate and analyze the received power and coverage area of a wireless system comprising a base station. We use a simplified path loss model, considering both scenarios with and without shadowing.

In the second part of the assignment, our focus shifts to a multi-path wireless system. Here, we undertake channel simulation, starting with an assumption of a wide-band channel. Subsequently, we explore the channel's behavior under the narrow-band condition, accounting for the Doppler effect for a receiver in motion.

## Computer Assignment 2
In this project, we focus on analyzing narrowband and frequency-selective channels and explore various message transmission techniques in these channels.

In the first section, we work with a narrowband channel and investigate the performance of conventional BPSK, binary, and QPSK transmission methods. We also attempt to mitigate the channel's effects at the receiver and improve signal estimation. Towards the end of this section, we delve into time diversity and the Alamouti method, which significantly enhance system performance.

Moving on to the next section, we delve into a frequency-selective channel. Here, we utilize the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) technique for data transmission. First, we thoroughly model the problem and then proceed with system simulation. We employ various methods, including Waterfilling, MRC, and Equalization, to achieve better performance. Additionally, we introduce clipping to simulate real-world systems, ultimately identifying the best system and its performance.
